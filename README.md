# jrdbase

Approach to my own solution to the problem called "Basic generic web application"
This is achieved by taking app generated by JHipster and successively transforming it to app that will meet my expectations
Which are:

* Full secure web application with login form and users.
* Authentication mechanism with roles and permissions
* Managing user profileswith rights, and administrative accounts.
* Translations in User Interface with several languages.
* Auditing and monitoring features (generated by JHipster)
* (other things, future demands will be written here)

This application was generated using JHipster, you can find documentation and help at [https://jhipster.github.io](https://jhipster.github.io).
